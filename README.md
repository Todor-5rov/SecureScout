# SecureScout üîí

A decentralized platform connecting trusted security professionals with clients worldwide through blockchain-powered escrow and smart contracts. Built for the Polkadot ecosystem on Passet Hub network.

## üéØ Project Overview

SecureScout is a Web3 marketplace that revolutionizes how security professionals and clients connect. It eliminates traditional intermediaries by using smart contracts for secure escrow, transparent job management, and trustless payments.

### Key Features

- **Decentralized Marketplace**: Direct peer-to-peer connections between security professionals and clients
- **Smart Contract Escrow**: Secure payment handling with automated release upon job completion
- **Reputation System**: Transparent rating and review system for both parties
- **Job Lifecycle Management**: Complete workflow from job posting to completion
- **Location-Based Matching**: Find security experts in specific geographic areas
- **Real-time Progress Tracking**: Monitor job progress with blockchain-verified updates

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### Smart Contract System

The platform consists of five main smart contracts deployed on Passet Hub:

#### 1. **SecureScoutHub** (Main Contract)

The central hub that orchestrates all interactions between users and other contracts.

**Key Functions:**

- User registration (Scouts and Agents)
- Job posting and management
- Payment processing
- Rating and review system
- Contract administration

#### 2. **UserRegistry**

Manages user profiles and authentication for both Scouts (clients) and Agents (security professionals).

**User Types:**

- **Scouts**: Clients who post security job requests
- **Agents**: Security professionals who provide services

**Profile Data:**

- Personal information (name, email, location)
- Service details (for agents: service type, pricing)
- Performance metrics (completed jobs, ratings, earnings)
- Availability status

#### 3. **JobRegistry**

Handles the complete job lifecycle from posting to completion.

**Job States:**

1. **Posted**: Job is available for applications
2. **Applied**: Agents have applied for the job
3. **Assigned**: An agent has been selected
4. **InProgress**: Work has begun
5. **Submitted**: Agent has submitted deliverables
6. **Completed**: Job is finished and payment released
7. **Disputed**: Job has issues requiring resolution
8. **Cancelled**: Job was cancelled

**Key Features:**

- Escrow-based payment system
- Progress tracking with blockchain verification
- Dispute resolution mechanism
- Automated payment release upon completion

#### 4. **PaymentRegistry**

Manages all financial transactions and escrow accounts.

**Functions:**

- Escrow fund management
- Payment release upon job completion
- Refund processing for cancelled jobs
- Earnings tracking for agents
- Withdrawal functionality

#### 5. **RatingRegistry**

Implements a transparent reputation system.

**Features:**

- Bidirectional rating (Scouts rate Agents, Agents rate Scouts)
- Review system with detailed feedback
- Average rating calculations
- Reputation history tracking

### Frontend Application

Built with React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS, the frontend provides an intuitive interface for all platform interactions.

#### Key Pages:

- **Landing Page**: Platform overview and wallet connection
- **Role Selection**: Choose between Scout (client) or Agent (professional)
- **Registration**: User profile creation for both roles
- **Scout Dashboard**: Job posting and management for clients
- **Agent Dashboard**: Job applications and service management for professionals
- **Agent Explorer**: Browse available security professionals

#### Technology Stack:

- **React 18** with TypeScript
- **Vite** for fast development and building
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling
- **Wagmi** for Web3 interactions
- **React Router** for navigation
- **Lucide React** for icons

## üöÄ Smart Contract Workflow

### For Scouts (Clients):

1. **Registration**: Create profile with name, email, and location
2. **Job Posting**: Submit security job with title, description, location, and budget
3. **Agent Selection**: Review applications and select preferred agent
4. **Progress Monitoring**: Track job progress through blockchain updates
5. **Completion Review**: Review deliverables and approve completion
6. **Payment Release**: Automatically release escrow funds to agent
7. **Rating**: Rate agent performance and leave review

### For Agents (Security Professionals):

1. **Registration**: Create profile with service type, pricing, and location
2. **Job Discovery**: Browse available security jobs
3. **Application**: Apply for jobs that match expertise
4. **Job Execution**: Complete assigned security tasks
5. **Progress Updates**: Submit regular progress updates
6. **Deliverable Submission**: Submit final deliverables and proof
7. **Payment Receipt**: Receive payment upon client approval
8. **Client Rating**: Rate client experience

## üõ†Ô∏è Development Setup

This project was bootstrapped using the [create-polkadot-dapp](https://github.com/paritytech/create-polkadot-dapp) template, which provides a complete development environment for Polkadot dApps.

### Prerequisites:

- Node.js 18+
- npm or yarn
- MetaMask wallet with Passet Hub network configured
- PAS tokens for gas fees

### Quick Start:

```bash
# Create a new project using the template
npx create-polkadot-dapp@latest

# Or clone this repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd SecureScout
```

### Smart Contract Development:

```bash
cd contracts
npm install
npx hardhat compile
npx hardhat test
```

### Frontend Development:

```bash
